# Code Samples
- This repository cnotains conde smaples from different projects I worked on. (some of them you can run directly)
## FPNN
This is a re-implemntaion of siame convolutional  model for person re-identification based on this paper : https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2014/papers/Li_DeepReID_Deep_Filter_2014_CVPR_paper.pdf
## welds 
I reimplemented a simple model from my master thesis in 2012 to detect weld seam in Xray images using PyTorch. (you can run it )
## camera_calibration_for_complex_scenes
sample codes for simulation I am using in my current work (you can run it)
## ground_plane_segmentation
U-net model to segment ground plane based on this paper : 
https://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/2016/5/icra_2016.pdf
(you can test it)
